# deluoode-translate-api

## The project is Work In Progress!

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. run `npm i` to get or update node modules

3. run `npm start` to launch the server

4. This project uses Swagger. Default url route is `/api-docs` to access swagger and test features once server is running

5. Otherwise you can edit the function main and call Deluscriber methods in `deluooder/deluooder.js`, then run `node deluooder/deluooder.js` to test without 
using Swagger.
